        <h2>What is <span class="helpJoin">Join</span>?</h2>

        <p>
            <span class="helpJoin">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part
            of
            their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.<br><br>

            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
            work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="helpJoin">Join</span>
            leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual
            interface.<br><br>
